# Multipart File Upload Service

This is a simple service that helps you upload files to a folder in your application.

Run the project ... It should start on port 7700

You can access the Swagger documentation through this link

Had to use an old swagger version because version 3.0.0 refused to show me the option to upload from Swagger.
